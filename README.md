# Weather-Detection-From-scene
This project introduces a unified framework using deep learning and WeatherNet architecture to predict conditions like cloudy, foggy, rain, shine, and sunrise from street-level images. WeatherNet's performance benefits autonomous vehicles, drive-assistance systems, behavior tracking, safety research, and urban policy-making.
